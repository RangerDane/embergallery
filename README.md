# Ember Gallery

[Live!](http://ember.gallery)

A gallery builder for Photographers and Artists. Designed to be very simple to
use - upload your work, organized by series, and you're done!

I got the idea for this app when I heard about the automatic cropping trend
going on right now - it marches on, oblivious to the fact that traditional
photographers consider naive cropping to be in poor taste.

Galleries are hosted at subdomain.ember.gallery

##Features:
* Multiple-session auth
* Subdomain gallery hosting (preview at [doot.ember.gallery](http://doot.ember.gallery) )
* Separation of assets (single javascript/css per gallery)

##Roadmap:
* Style class to dynamically generate CSS based on user style preferences
* Different templates per gallery
* Build out a very simple editor for galleries
* Compile JSON and CSS into static assets hosted on a CDN
* Allow easy user upload of images through the browser
