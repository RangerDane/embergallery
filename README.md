# Ember Gallery

I created this app to solve a simple problem - overcomplicated gallery creation
sites. A lot of services offer a host of features, like automatic
cropping, without regard to the fact that photographers often do not want
their images cropped.

This app is designed with the traditional photographer in mind

Roadmap:
* Compile JSON and CSS into static assets hosted on a CDN
* Allow easy user upload of images through the browser
